  /**
   * Element class mixin to add the ability to skip strict dirty-checking for
   * objects and arrays (always consider them to be "dirty"), for use on
   * elements utilizing `Polymer.PropertyEffects`
   *
   * By default, `Polymer.PropertyEffects` performs strict dirty checking on
   * objects, which means that any deep modifications to an object or array will
   * not be propagated unless "immutable" data patterns are used (i.e. all object
   * references from the root to the mutation were changed).
   *
   * Polymer also provides a proprietary data mutation and path notification API
   * (e.g. `notifyPath`, `set`, and array mutation API's) that allow efficient
   * mutation and notification of deep changes in an object graph to all elements
   * bound to the same object graph.
   *
   * In cases where neither immutable patterns nor the data mutation API can be
   * used, applying this mixin will allow Polymer to skip dirty checking for
   * objects and arrays (always consider them to be "dirty").  This allows a
   * user to make a deep modification to a bound object graph, and then either
   * simply re-set the object (e.g. `this.items = this.items`) or call `notifyPath`
   * (e.g. `this.notifyPath('items')`) to update the tree.  Note that all
   * elements that wish to be updated based on deep mutations must apply this
   * mixin or otherwise skip strict dirty checking for objects/arrays.
   *
   * The second `strictByDefault` argument to the mixin determines whether
   * the element defaults to strict dirty checking or not. In cases where
   * the intent is to allow the element user to determine the dirty checking
   * strategy, set this argument to `true` and the element user can apply the
   * `mutable-data` attribute (or set the `mutableData` property) to skip
   * Object/Array dirty checking.
   *
   * Note, the performance characteristics of propagating large object graphs
   * will be worse by relying on `mutableData: true` as opposed to using
   * strict dirty checking with immutable patterns or Polymer's path notification
   * API.
